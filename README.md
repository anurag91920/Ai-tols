Auto-generates responsive web/mobile layouts.
Dora AI (for web apps)

Text-to-interactive-website in seconds.
Great for landing pages or MVPs.
✅ Output: Visual UI ready for frontend generation

💻 Phase 3: Frontend Code Generation (No Coding)
Turn your design into working frontend code using AI.

🔧 Tools:
Vercel v0 (by Vercel)

AI generates React/Tailwind code from text.
Prompt:
"Create a responsive dashboard with a sidebar, mood chart, and AI chat window using React and Tailwind."

Instantly deploys on Vercel.
DhiWise

Upload Figma → AI generates React, Flutter code.
Supports state management and routing.
MarsX

Say: "Build a mobile app frontend for a carbon footprint tracker with login, dashboard, and history."
Outputs React Native or Flutter code.
✅ Output: Working frontend with navigation, styling, and components

⚙️ Phase 4: Backend & API Generation
Create a backend with authentication, logic, and APIs — no backend coding.

🔧 Tools:
Mintlify Brain (or Cursor.sh)

AI that writes full backend in Node.js, Python, etc.
Prompt:
"Create a Node.js Express API with user login, mood entry storage, and AI response endpoint using OpenAI."

Appsmith (AI Mode)

Generate backend logic + database queries visually.
Connect to any DB and create REST APIs.
Toolform.ai

Describe your app → AI builds backend + frontend + DB.
Example:
"Create a habit tracker with user accounts and streaks."

✅ Output: REST API with CRUD operations and auth

🗄️ Phase 5: Database & Storage
Set up a database without writing SQL or schema.

🔧 Tools:
Supabase + AI Assist

Use natural language to create tables.
Prompt in Supabase:
"Create a 'users' table with email, name, and last_login."

Auto-generates Postgres DB + auth.
Firebase + FireGen AI

Describe your data → AI sets up Firestore collections.
Great for real-time apps.
DynamoDB + Amazon CodeWhisperer

AI suggests schema and queries based on your app description.
✅ Output: Live database with data models and relationships

🤖 Phase 6: AI Features Integration
Add smart features like chatbots, predictions, or NLP.

🔧 Tools:
OpenAI API (via AI prompts)

Use AI to generate code for:
AI chatbot
Text summarization
Sentiment analysis (e.g., mood from journal entries)
Hugging Face + Replicate

Add pre-trained AI models (e.g., emotion detection, image recognition).
No code: just API calls generated by AI.
Voiceflow or Landbot

Build AI chatbots with drag-and-drop, then embed in your app.
✅ Output: Smart features that impress judges

🚀 Phase 7: Deployment & Hosting (One-Click)
Deploy your full-stack app instantly.

🔧 Tools:
Vercel

Deploy frontend in 1 click. Integrates with v0, Next.js.
Render or Railway.app

Deploy backend and database with AI-generated config.
Netlify

Great for static sites and Jamstack apps.
GitHub + AI (GitHub Copilot)

AI helps commit, push, and deploy via CLI commands.
✅ Output: Live URL to show judges

📊 Phase 8: Presentation & Pitch Deck
Win with a strong story and visuals.

🔧 Tools:
Tome.app

AI generates beautiful pitch decks from text.
Prompt:
"Create a 5-slide pitch deck for a mental health AI journal app with problem, solution, tech stack, and demo."

Beautiful.ai

AI-powered slides with smart formatting.
Canva + Magic Design

Turn idea into presentation in seconds.
✅ Output: Professional pitch deck in minutes

🏁 Phase 9: Demo & Submission
Show a working prototype with impact.

Tips:
Use Loom or Opus to record a 2-minute demo.
Highlight: Problem, AI innovation, working demo, impact.
Mention: "Built entirely with AI tools in 24 hours."
🛠️ All-in-One AI Tools (Bonus)
These platforms can do almost everything in one place:

MarsX.dev

Say: "Build a student mental health app with chat, journal, and mood analytics."
Outputs: Frontend, backend, DB, deploy link.
Dora AI

Text → Full website/app with animations and interactivity.
Builder.io + AI

Visual drag-and-drop + AI code generation.
Retool + AI

Build internal tools or MVPs with AI-generated logic.
